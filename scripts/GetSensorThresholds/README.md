## Prerequisites

This script requires Python 3.X and iDRAC 6.x+. **NOTE**: Using [Metric Property](#using-the-metric-property-option) will still work in iDRAC <6.x. The [Metric Reports](#using-the-metric-report-option) will only work for some report types. In the reports that do not work you will receive an error message.

## Help

```bash
python tests/idrac_ft/telemetry_ft/GetSensorThresholds.py -h
usage: GetSensorThresholds.py [-h] ip user password metricproperty
```

Python script using Redfish http get to find the sensor thresholds of a given
metric property or a metric report.

positional arguments:
```
ip              iDRAC IP address
user            iDRAC username
password        iDRAC password
metricproperty  Metric property or metric report
```

optional arguments:

```
-h, --help      show this help message and exit
```

**Examples**
find the sensor thresholds of a given metric property or metric report:
- To get sensor threshold values for a metricproperty.
  - `GetSensorThresholds.py 1.10.1.10 root mypasswd /redfish/v1/Systems/System.Embedded.1/Oem/Dell/DellNumericSensors/iDRAC.Embedded.1_0x23_SystemBoardSYSUsage#CurrentReading`
- To get sensor threshold values for all the metricproperties in a metric report.
  - `GetSensorThresholds.py 1.10.1.10 root mypasswd Sensor`
  - `GetSensorThresholds.py 1.10.1.10 root mypasswd /redfish/v1/TelemetryService/MetricReports/Sensor`

**Notes**
Please note the argument list is positional arguments, example provided.

## Example Results

### Using the Metric Property Option:

What this does is allows you to specify some specific property offered from Dell. If you want to look up a complete listing of properties perform a GET against the endpoint `https://<idrac_ip>/redfish/v1/Systems/System.Embedded.1/`. If you only wanted to see the `DellNumericSensors` endpoint you would perform a GET against `https://<idrac_ip>https://192.168.1.45/redfish/v1/Systems/System.Embedded.1/Oem/Dell/DellNumericSensors` For example output see [this json](sample_dellnumericsensors.json)

```bash
python tests/idrac_ft/telemetry_ft/GetSensorThresholds.py 1.10.1.10 root mypasswd /redfish/v1/Systems/System.Embedded.1/Oem/Dell/DellNumericSensors/iDRAC.Embedded.1_0x23_SystemBoardInletTemp
Lower Threshold Critical:-7
Lower Threshold Warning:3
Upper Threshold Critical:42
Upper Threshold Warning:38
Successfully found the thresholds for '/redfish/v1/Systems/System.Embedded.1/Oem/Dell/DellNumericSensors/iDRAC.Embedded.1_0x23_SystemBoardInletTemp'.
```

### Using the Metric Report Option

You can view the various report types by performing a GET against the URL `https://<your_ip>/redfish/v1/TelemetryService/MetricReports`. It is important to note that whether all of these work depends on which reports you have enabled. [This](reports.json) is an example of what the results look like.

```bash
python tests/idrac_ft/telemetry_ft/GetSensorThresholds.py 100.69.116.150 root calvin Sensor
For metric report: Sensor
Thresholds for mp:'/redfish/v1/Systems/System.Embedded.1/Oem/Dell/DellNumericSensors/0x17__Fan.Embedded.1' are below:
Lower Threshold Critical:480
Lower Threshold Warning:840
Upper Threshold Critical property is null
Upper Threshold Warning property is null
Thresholds for mp:'/redfish/v1/Systems/System.Embedded.1/Oem/Dell/DellNumericSensors/0x17__Fan.Embedded.4' are below:
Lower Threshold Critical:480
Lower Threshold Warning:840
Upper Threshold Critical property is null
Upper Threshold Warning property is null
...
Thresholds for mp:'/redfish/v1/Systems/System.Embedded.1/Oem/Dell/DellNumericSensors/0x17__Fan.Embedded.6' are below:
Lower Threshold Critical:480
Lower Threshold Warning:840
Upper Threshold Critical property is null
Upper Threshold Warning property is null
Successfully found the thresholds for 'Sensor'.
```

## Default Log Level

The current default log level is warning. Other options include info and debug. For additional details see detailed log. You can change the log level by adjusting the line `logger.setLevel(logging.WARNING)` in the [GetSensorThresholds.py](GetSensorThresholds.py) script.
