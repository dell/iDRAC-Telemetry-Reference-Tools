# getent group ${GROUP_ID} - Get the name of the group. Ex: `somegroup:x:999:`. This makes sure the group exists
# echo groupdel by-id ${GROUP_ID} - This is just there to tell the user what we're doing
# groupdel $(getent group ${GROUP_ID} | cut -d: -f1) - Gets the group string as above (`somegroup:x:999:`)
# and then passes it into `cut -d: -f1` which will grab the `somegroup` part and pass that into groupdel
# ||: The || is the or operator and : is the null operator. This just has the effect of ensuring the line
# returns with "success" rather than failure in the event the group doesn't exist
